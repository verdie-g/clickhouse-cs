**Breaking Changes:**


**New Features/Improvements:**
 * Added support for setting roles at the connection and command levels.
 * Added support for custom headers at the connection level.
 * Added support for JWT/Bearer token authentication at both connection and command levels.
 * Added `InsertRawStreamAsync` method to `ClickHouseConnection` for inserting raw data streams (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) directly from files or memory. Check out the examples on GitHub for usage examples of all the above.
 * When the query id has not been set, it will now be automatically generated by the client.
 * Added support for writing `byte[]` values to String type columns via BulkCopy.

**Bug Fixes:**
 * Fixed a crash when reading a Map with duplicate keys. The current behavior is to return only the last value for a given key.
